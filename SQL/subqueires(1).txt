CROSS JOIN 

-- A Cross Join produces the Cartesian product of two tables,
--  meaning it combines every row from the first
 -- table with every row from the second table.
--  It does not require any condition for joining.
select * from Orders
SELECT * FROM  customer cross join orders

-- A subquery is a query nested inside another query. 
It is executed first, and its result is
--  used by the outer query. 
Subqueries are often used to perform intermediate calculations
 or filtering.

--  Find customers older than the youngest customer.

select * from Customer

--  quantity less than 100.
 
select Name from Customer 
where id in 
(select customer_id from orders where quantity <100 )

 -- average order quantity.
 
 select * from Customer where id in 
 (select customer_id   from orders where 
 Quantity >  (select avg(Quantity) from Orders))
